* iced-dialog - some basic dialogs on ice

** Why

I would like to have GUI dialogs in ludusavi for alerts and confirmation which
can be easily "navigated" even with the gamepad controls on a Steam Deck.

As of 2023-12 I don't know of any library which does that, so this project is my
attempt.

Time will show if this works out or not.

Feedback welcome!
